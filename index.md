### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

1. Lab 03 specifically part 2. I really enjoyed working on this lab because of how daunting it looked first glance. 
It is a very mean looking problem and can be very overwhelming. I feel like I had a great team mate Andrew who helped me break it down in smaller pieces and more manageable. 
Once we broke it down and tackled the problem we came up with a valid solution! This is one of the first labs that made me feel confident in studying computer science.


* Lab 5
2.  Lab 05 was another lab I really enjoyed working on with my lab partner. This is the lab that really tested my knowledge in C++. This lab part 2 consisted of using static_cast < > and working with truncate. It is a great lesson that really made me understand the difference of double and int and when its better to use one versus the other. 


* Lab 7
3. Lab 07 part 2 was another lab that I enjoyed working on. This one really tested mine and my partners skills and understanding. This is the only lab that really made me question my sanity. The parking assignment was one that took time and accuracy and understanding. My lab partner and I spent extra time outside of class to complete this lab but in the end I feel like I really learned from this lab the most. It caused me to really study and research more in depth & honestly my most favorite lab. I know feel confident in ever working on a project like this again.
